## Summary
A retailer selling your personal information (assuming that is without your consent) raises multiple ethical questions and problems. First, if you (as a customer) do not give consent to the retail store to use user *your* personal information, doing so it's unethical because even though the data is on their software, the data is still yours. Also, making profit by using data that's not yours (without consent) is unethical. Both the Retail Software and the other end that's using the data would be technical systems that are affected.
