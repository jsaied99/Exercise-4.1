## Summary
A retailer selling your personal information (assuming that it is without your consent) raises multiple ethical questions and problems. First, if you (as a customer) do not consent to the retail store to use user *your* personal information, it's unethical because even though the data is on their software, the data is still yours. Also, making a profit by using data that's not yours (without consent) is unethical. Both the Retail Software and the other end using the data would be technical systems that are affected.  

When it comes to personal information, there should be: 1) consent 2) the owner of the information to be used know what type of use the retailer is going to do with that information. At all times, individual privacy and data ownership should be respected. In this particular case, the retailer is doing wrong by selling the data to a third party without the customer's consent. If there are consent and awareness of what will happen with the information provided, there will be no ethical violation.
